# Cash-Register-System

The cash register project is a simple project performed under the guidance of neoG camp that allows a cashier to process a customer's purchase and calculate the change due. The system will prompt the cashier to enter the total bill amount and the amount tendered by the customer. It will then calculate the difference between the two and display the change due to the customer.
